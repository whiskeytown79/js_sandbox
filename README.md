Javascript sandbox for playing around with JS

This uses Node.js and Jest to run tests. To be able to run these files, make sure
Node.js is installed, and use `npm install` prior to running tests to make sure
all the dependencies get installed.

Run tests by running: `npm run test` on the command line.
